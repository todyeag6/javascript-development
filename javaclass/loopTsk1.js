/*Write a while loop that will display all the numbers from 5 to 25. Ensure

you use the 3 key factors for a while loop. The body of this loop should have a log statement to display

your results. The result should look like the one in the image.*/


    let counter = 5
    while (counter <= 25) {
        console.log(counter);
        counter ++        
    }

// Instructor's feedback: The instructions ask for a while loop; not a for loop.
